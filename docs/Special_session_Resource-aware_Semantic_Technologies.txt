As Semantic Technologies gain momentum, their impact on resources and
society increases. At the same time application developers would like
to employ semantic technologies on devices that are heavily resource
constrained such as mobile devices. So far the efficiency of semantic
technologies is still mainly assessed by running times. While
computational and cognitive complexity are investigated, work on their
resource consumption, e.g. in terms of energy or storage, is still in
its infancy. However, assessing, managing and predicting the
resource-consumption is a vital prerequisite for the wider usefulness
of semantic technologies.

The special session calls for contributions regarding, but not limited
to the following topics:

- resource-adaptive semantic technologies
- reasoning algorithms for resource-bound hardware
- measurement frameworks for energy-consumption of semantic technologies
- ontologies for energy management
- prediction methods for resource consumption
- application of semantic technologies for resource management
