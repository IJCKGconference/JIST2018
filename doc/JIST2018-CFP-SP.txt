interested in. We also intend to facilitate participation of potentially-related
researchers in the JIST conference.

The papers submitted to special sessions are handled as regular or short
papers, which should not be longer than 16 or 8 pages including
references, respectively. The papers are reviewed *mainly* by the PC

Track chairs and the PC chairs.

conference proceedings. The presentations in the conference are located
in each special session chaired by the proponent.
