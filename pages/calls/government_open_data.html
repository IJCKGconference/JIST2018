<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
The Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) is a regional federation of Semantic Technology related conferences. The mission of JIST is to bring together researchers in Semantic Technology research community and other areas of semantic related technologies to present their innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Addressing society's problem using the community driven becomes one of the major issues in many countries .The availability of open data creates opportunities for all kinds of organizations, government agencies and not-for-profits to come up with new ways of addressing society's problems. A lot of government organizations, such as, USA, European Union, UK, Taiwan, Japan Thailand, provide dataset for public available.  Apply Semantic Technology, and Linked Data is one of the important issue for the utilization of open government data.
