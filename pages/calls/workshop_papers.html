<h2 id="ws1">The Joint International Workshop on PAOS2018 and PASSCR2018</h2>

<h4>The Fifth International Workshop on Practical Application of Ontology for Semantic Data Engineering (PAOS2018)</h4>

<h4>Scope</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    Linked Data is now recognized as one of the prominent ways for publishing data on the web. Even though Linked Data Technology
    is the results of the long-term development in Semantic Web Community, it is not easy to deploy it to the real problems
    and often needs to be adapted for different domains. Applying ontology to augment publishing and analyzing semantic data
    is one of the most important research areas. Ontology and ontology-based application can enhance modeling and processing
    of the semantic data, especially the data in specific domains, in terms of data integration, interoperability, reusability
    and intelligence.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    In this workshop, we want to share the experience and solutions to apply ontologies to enhance semantic data management,
    focusing on Linked Data publishing and consumption in specific domains. We welcome not only Semantic Web researchers
    but also knowledge engineers, and domain experts, who developed and applied ontologies and ontology-based applications
    for enhancing semantic data publishing and analysis for specific domains.
</p>

<h4>Topics of interest</h4>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Ontology Design and Modelling for Supporting Semantic Data Processing
        <ul>
            <li>Ontology for specific domains (e.g. health care, education, open government, travel, culture, library, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Knowledge acquisition from domain experts</li>
            <li>Knowledge acquisition and learning from data</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ontology and its Application for Enhancing Linked Data Publishing
        <ul>
            <li>Ontology-based conversion of data to RDF </li>
            <li>Ontology-based data integration </li>
            <li>Ontology-based identity management </li>
            <li>Ontology-based database schema mapping </li>
            <li>Domain-specific models for Linked data publishing </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ontology and its Application for Enhancing Linked Data Consumption
        <ul>
            <li>Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA) </li>
            <li>Ontology-based Linked data application framework</li>
            <li>Domain-dependent semantic data analysis (e.g. quality assessment, data visualization, etc.)</li>
            <li>Ontology-based interface and interaction for Linked data application </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<h4>The 3rd International Workshop on Platforms and Applications for Social problem Solving and Collective Reasoning (PASSCR2018)</h4>

<h4>Scope</h4>

<p class="text-justify">
    There are emerging demands on integrating various techniques, tools, and platforms to enhance and accommodate social intelligence
    to solve various social issues, such as increasing/decreasing of populations, which often requires consensus building
    among people having conflicting preferences. Although huge efforts have been done on AI-based heuristic approaches to
    solve various kind of social problems, better utilization of reasoning techniques is the key to make reasonable and agreeable
    decisions and actions to solve such issues since it has an ability to better explain what and why of those decisions
    are made as well as managing the processes of them. The organizers also believe that, providing well-designed platforms
    and tools to construct such applications will be crucial.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    This Workshop welcomes researchers as well as practitioners from the fields of AI-based applications and platforms as well
    as related fields in AI, agents, and semantic technologies (e.g., mechanism design, social choice, and other agent-based
    technologies such as automated negotiation among intelligent software, applications to robotics and human-robot interactions,
    reasoning on logics and ontological descriptions, intelligent access to open data, and other related fields). This workshop
    aims to promote state-of-the-art techniques and platforms to the attendees and give them a good opportunity to emerge
    future collaborations.

</p>

<h4>Topics of interest</h4>
Potential topics of interests are following:
<ul>
    <li>collective reasoning and collective intelligence </li>
    <li>social and large scale consensus support </li>
    <li>open government data platforms and tools </li>
    <li>civic tech applications</li>
    <li>ontology-based reasoning platforms</li>
    <li>negotiation and consensus building technologies</li>
    <li>applications of ontology and reasoning for social issues</li>
    <li>computer-supported cooperative work</li>
    <li>tools and techniques for efficient and easier open data access with inferences</li>
    <li>applications and platforms for social consensus buildings and human-robot interactions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ws2">Workshop on Semantic Government Open Data (SGOD2018)</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Semantic Technology can make government open data more useful and more valuable. In conjunction with the Special Session
    on Government Open Data,, various stakeholders will gather and discuss how semantic technology can be applied to government
    open data and what kind of value can be added by its application. The workshop will provide a round table with some short
    presentations of ongoing projects related to government open data.
