Submissions to JIST 2018 are expected to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to support their claims. All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. To assess submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the readability of the submission.
<br><br>
JIST 2018 submissions are not anonymous.
<br><br>
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submissions must be no longer than 16 pages. Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.
<br><br>
