The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) is to bring together researchers in the Semantic Technology research community and other areas of semantic-related technologies to present their innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
There are two tracks in JIST 2018.
</p>

</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
Submissions to JIST 2018 should describe original, significant research on semantic technologies. JIST 2018 will not accept submissions that are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Submissions to JIST 2018 are expected to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to support their claims. All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three members of the program committee of either research track or special session track. To assess submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the readability of the submission.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
JIST 2018 submissions are not anonymous.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer Publications format for <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs">Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)</a>. Regular paper submissions must be no longer than 16 pages, and short paper submissions must be no longer than 8 pages. Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Accepted papers of both research track and special session track will be published in an <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs">LNCS</a> proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.
