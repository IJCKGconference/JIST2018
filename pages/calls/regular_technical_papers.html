The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) is to bring together researchers in the Semantic Technology research community and other areas of semantic-related technologies to present their innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
There are two tracks in JIST 2018.
</p>

<h3>Research Track</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
JIST 2018 research track solicits submissions of original research work on semantic technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ontology and reasoning</li>
    <li>Knowledge graph</li>
    <li>Linked Data</li>
    <li>Big Data and semantics, exchange and integration</li>
    <li>Data streams and the Internet of Things</li>
    <li>Machine learning and information extraction on the Semantic Web</li>
    <li>Semantic Web services and processes</li>
    <li>Trust, privacy, and security on the Semantic Web</li>
    <li>Social Semantic Web</li>
    <li>Natural language processing and semantics</li>
    <li>Semantic multimedia</li>
    <li>Novel applications of semantic technologies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Session Track</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
JIST 2018 special session track to discover and implement special topics that researchers in Semantic Technology are particularly interested in. We also intend to facilitate participation of potentially-related researchers in the JIST conference. Topics of special sessions are as follows:

</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
Submissions to JIST 2018 should describe original, significant research on semantic technologies. JIST 2018 will not accept submissions that are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference(*).
<br>
* Non peer-reviewed documents such as theses, tech reports, publications on
preprint server (e.g. arXiv.org) are not considered prior publications. Thus
 JIST2018 authors are not precluded to submit papers on the same topic by the
same authors.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
Submissions to JIST 2018 are expected to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to support their claims.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three members of the program committee of either research track or special session track. To assess submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the readability of the submission.
</p>


<p class="text-justify">
JIST 2018 submissions are not anonymous.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer Publications format for <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs">Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)</a>. Regular paper submissions must be no longer than 16 pages, and short paper submissions must be no longer than 8 pages. Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Accepted papers of both research track and special session track will be published in an <a href="https://www.springer.com/lncs">LNCS</a> proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.
