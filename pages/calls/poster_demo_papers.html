    JIST 2018 Posters and Demonstration complement the full papers of the conference and offer an opportunity for presenting
    late-breaking research results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Poster and
    Demo presentations allow researchers to present and to receive direct feedback from audience about significant work in
    progress, bleeding-edge work, or research that is best communicated in an interactive or graphical fashion.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Technology, which would address, but are not limited to, the topics
    of mentioned in the Call for Papers of JIST2018 full papers. Descriptions of ongoing / completed research work, reports
    on semantic software systems, "idea papers" (raising an interesting question or motivating an interesting line of research
    without already having solid results), position papers presenting a birds' eye view on some aspect of Semantic Technology
    in the sense of a meta-analysis, and PhD thesis abstracts are all welcome. Demonstrations are intended to showcase innovative
    Semantic Technology and related implementations. All submissions are intended to convey a scientific result or work in
    progress and should not be advertisements for commercial software packages.
