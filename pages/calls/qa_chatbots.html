<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
  This year, JIST features a special track about "Question Answering and ChatBots", which is an opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in chatbots and question answering to present their ideas and discuss the most important scientific and technical challenges of these emerging fields which both drive a large share of the current innovative products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Making sense of data is one of the core tasks within a data-driven world where the amount of data is increasing permanently w.r.t. the number of data items, categories, interlinks or properties in general.
  <br/>
  Providing an interactive interface for deciphering the available information is the task of question answering as well as of chatbots. Although both research fields target similar challenges and successful system combine technologies from both fields (e.g., well established dialogue managers and answer ranking) a knowledge transfer between both communities seems to be expandable.
  <br/>
  This special track provides a platform for both communities or research dedicated to at least one field, respectively.

<p class="text-justify">
The special track "Question Answering and ChatBots" at JIST 2018 welcomes the submission of papers on novel scientific research, innovations, ideas and/or experience reports relevant to the topics of this special track. Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. This track has a single-blind review process (author names are visible to reviewers, reviewers stay anonymous by default but we encourage reviewers to sign their reviews). The submitted abstract and the topics are leveraged to find adequate reviewers for submitted papers. Please write an email to the program chairs, if you have any questions.
