JIST 2018 introduces <b>Special Sessions</b> to discover and implement special topics that researchers in Semantic Technology are particularly interested in. We also intend to facilitate participation of potentially-related researchers in the JIST conference.
	<br/>
	<br/>
The papers submitted to special sessions are <b>handled as regular or short papers</b>, which should not be longer than 16 or 8 pages including references, respectively. The papers are <b>reviewed *mainly* by the PC members dedicated for each special session</b>, and acceptance/rejection will be decided based on consultation with the Special Session Track chairs and the PC chairs.
	<br/>
	<br/>
The accepted papers in the special sessions will be included in the conference proceedings. The presentations in the conference are located in each special session chaired by the proponent.
