      This year, JIST features a special track about "Question Answering and ChatBots", which is an opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in chatbots and question answering to present their ideas and discuss the most important scientific and technical challenges of these emerging fields which both drive a large share of the current innovative products.

      As Semantic Technologies gain momentum, their impact on resources and society increases. At the same time application developers would like to employ semantic technologies on devices that are heavily resource constrained such as mobile devices. So far the efficiency of semantic technologies is still mainly assessed by running times. Its vertical scalability (scale-up) has been investigated for a while now. So far adaptive horizontal scalability (scale-out) of semantic technologies and systems is hardly investigated. Here the challenge is to utilize resources opportunistically and efficiently, based on availability and the application requirements. This is significant and challenging in semantic-enabled contexts -- especially in those with dynamic networks of independent devices, such as multi-agent systems and IoT.

      The massive, high-quality life sciences databases present a significant analytical challenge due to their complexity and heterogeneous nature. The lack of well- defined standards of formats makes it tedious for bioinformaticians and other researchers alike to obtain data before they can conduct analysis and visual- isation. Semantic Web technologies can contribute to discovering knowledge such as drug discovery and protein pathway prediction, which would be a huge contribution to the biology community. This special track focuses on applying Semantic Web technologies to life sciences data, such as knowledge representa- tion, data integration, and knowledge discovery, and reasoning, etc.
