    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p class="allign-justify">
            Autonomous driving is becoming more of reality day by day. Major car makers have announced to roll out self-driving cars around 2020. However, the prospective self-driving level is level 2 or 3 out of five levels. Levels 2 and 3 require human control or frequent intervention. On the other hand, levels 4 and 5 mean almost all the time and full-time automation, respectively. To achieve the level 5 self-driving, we need knowledge systems that are able to make decisions as humans do. In this respect, autonomous driving is a good application area of Semantic Technology. In this talk, Sasaki will present the recent advances of Semantic Technology in the self-driving field and his approach to Ontology-based self-driving at uncontrolled intersections.
