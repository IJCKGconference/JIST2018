    In the first half of this tutorial, we will explain how to practically use semantic web 
    features of an enterprise database, Oracle Database 18c. We will not focus on the product 
    specific how-to, but discuss how those functions can be implemented in the actual database 
    management system.</p>

<ul>
    <li>How to build a triplestore and SPARQL endpoint</li>
    <li>How to run OWL inferences and custom rules</li>
    <li>How to convert table data to RDF data using R2RML</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-justify">
    In the latter half, we will introduce graph database features of Oracle Database 18c for 
    showing the difference between RDF graph model and property graph model.</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is property graph model</li>
    <li>What is graph database</li>
    <li>How to convert RDF data to property graph data</li>
</ul>
